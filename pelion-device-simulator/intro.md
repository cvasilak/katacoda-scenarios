# Introduction
Welcome to Pelion Device Management Tutorial!

In this tutorial, you'll securely connect a virtual device that contains a vibration sensor to [Pelion Device Management](https://www.pelion.com/iot-device-management/) and interact with it using the portal. Further, you'll build a new firmware image and apply a delta update on the device by starting an update campaign.

The purpose is to quickly demonstrate available functionality, even if you don't own a [Pelion Ready](https://developer.pelion.com/boards/) hardware but still want to experience the features of the platform. 

If you are new to Pelion, the platform provides a number of features:

* Secure connection for a wide range of device classes, including ultra-constrained, constrained, mainstream, rich nodes and gateways.
* Flexible platform deployment options - from public clouds, like AWS, to on-premise deployments.
* Complete lifecycle management, from factory provisioning, through secure device onboarding and robust device monitoring and control, to end-of-life device decommission.
* Secure firmware update services including delta updates suitable for low-bandwidth and mesh-based networks.
* Support for legacy protocols with the Pelion Edge gateway.
* Device Management Portal and easy integration with enterprise systems using REST APIs.

**Let's get started !**
