# Introduction
Welcome to Pelion Device Management Connection Tutorial !

In this tutorial you'll securely connect a simulated board to [Pelion Device Management](https://www.pelion.com/iot-device-management/) and interact with it using the portal.

If you are new to Pelion, the platform provides a number of features:

* Secure connection for a wide range of device classes, including ultra-constrained, constrained, mainstream, rich nodes and gateways.
* Flexible platform deployment options - from public clouds, like AWS, to on-premise deployments.
* Complete lifecycle management, from factory provisioning, through secure device onboarding and robust device monitoring and control, to end-of-life device deletion.
* Secure firmware update services including delta updates suitable for low-bandwidth and mesh-based networks.
* Support for legacy protocols with the Pelion Edge gateway.
* Device Management Portal and easy integration with enterprise systems using REST APIs.
