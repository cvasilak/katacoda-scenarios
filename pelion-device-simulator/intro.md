# Introduction
Welcome to Pelion Device Management Connection Tutorial !

In this tutorial you'll securely connect a simulated board to [Pelion Device Management](https://www.pelion.com/iot-device-management/) and interact with it using the portal. The purpose is to quickly demonstrate available functionality even if you don't own hardware but still want to experience the features of the platform. 

If you are new to Pelion, the platform provides a number of features:

* Secure connection for a wide range of device classes, including ultra-constrained, constrained, mainstream, rich nodes and gateways.
* Flexible platform deployment options - from public clouds, like AWS, to on-premise deployments.
* Complete lifecycle management, from factory provisioning, through secure device onboarding and robust device monitoring and control, to end-of-life device deletion.
* Secure firmware update services including delta updates suitable for low-bandwidth and mesh-based networks.
* Support for legacy protocols with the Pelion Edge gateway.
* Device Management Portal and easy integration with enterprise systems using REST APIs.

**Let's get started !**
