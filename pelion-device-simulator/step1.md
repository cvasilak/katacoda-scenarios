Before starting the simulator and connect to Pelion Device Management, we need to create an _API Key_ from the Pelion portal. The key would be used during bootstrapping to provision automatically a [developer certificate](https://www.pelion.com/docs/device-management/current/provisioning-process/provisioning-development-devices.html) on behalf of us and use it thereafter to connect to the device management service.
