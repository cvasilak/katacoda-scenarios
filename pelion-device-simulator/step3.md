> NOTE: If you are presented with an _"Unable to connect"_ error message upon clicking on the tab, don't worry! Because the simulator takes some time to start, the platform timeouts attempting to connect. Click either the "Try Again" or hit the Refresh button ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/YtMtg4x/refresh.png "Refresh") to manually connect.

You should be presented with the following screen:

Notice the simulator printing out the **"Endpoint Name"** after the successfully connection to Pelion Device Management Service.

If you now visit the [Device List](https://portal.mbedcloud.com/devices/list) in Pelion portal should display the device as '_Connected_'
